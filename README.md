# The_N-body_Problem
N-Body Simulation Using Python  This repository contains a Python implementation of an N-Body Simulation using vector-based physics. The code models the gravitational interaction between multiple bodies over time, calculating their positions, velocities, and accelerations based on Newton's laws of motion and gravitation.
